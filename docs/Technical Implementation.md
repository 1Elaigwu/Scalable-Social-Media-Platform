## Technical Implementation

### Database Schemas

The platform utilizes both SQL and NoSQL databases, each with its own schema tailored to the specific needs of the data it stores.

**SQL Schemas:** These schemas define the structure of relational data stored in PostgreSQL. They include tables, columns, constraints, and relationships that ensure data integrity and facilitate complex queries. For example, the SQL schema for user data includes tables for user profiles, authentication details, and relationships between users and their posts.

**NoSQL Schemas:** MongoDB is used for storing semi-structured data such as posts, comments, and notifications. NoSQL schemas are designed to accommodate the flexible nature of document-based storage. Each document can have varying fields and structures, allowing for rapid iteration and scaling. For example, the MongoDB schema for a post includes fields for content, author information, timestamps, and associated comments.

### Caching

Redis is employed as a caching layer to store frequently accessed data in memory. This helps reduce the load on primary databases and improves response times for read-heavy operations. Key data such as user profiles, popular posts, and recent comments are cached to ensure quick retrieval. Redis supports various data structures like strings, hashes, lists, and sets, making it versatile for different caching needs.

### Search Indexing

Elasticsearch is integrated into the platform to provide powerful full-text search capabilities. It indexes data from both MongoDB and PostgreSQL, enabling efficient and scalable search functionality across the platform. Elasticsearch's distributed nature allows for horizontal scaling and high availability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of search queries. Real-time updates ensure that search results are always up-to-date, providing users with accurate and relevant information.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is established using GitHub Actions. This automated workflow enables developers to continuously integrate code changes into a shared repository, run automated tests, and deploy updates to production environments. The CI/CD pipeline ensures that new features and updates are thoroughly tested and deployed in a timely manner, reducing manual errors and improving development efficiency.

### Monitoring

System performance is monitored using Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus collects metrics and time-series data from various components of the platform, including databases, microservices, and infrastructure. Grafana provides visualization and analysis tools to create dashboards and alerts based on the collected metrics. Monitoring system performance in real-time allows for proactive detection of issues and timely response to maintain system health and reliability.
