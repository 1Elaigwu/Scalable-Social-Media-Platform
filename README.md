## API Documentation
- **User Service API**: Endpoints for user management, including registration, login, profile updates, and user search.
- **Post Service API**: API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
- **Comment Service API**: API endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting comments on posts.
- **Notification Service API**: Endpoints for managing user notifications, such as sending and retrieving notifications.

## Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables for database connections, API keys, and other configuration parameters in each service.
- **Docker Compose**: Use docker-compose.yml to define services, networks, and volumes for local development and deployment.
- **Kubernetes Config**: Define Kubernetes manifests for deploying services, configuring pods, and setting up persistent volumes.

Scalable Social Media Platform
Overview
The Scalable Social Media Platform is designed to efficiently handle a large user base and high volumes of data. It leverages modern technologies and architectural patterns to ensure scalability, performance, and reliability. The platform is built using a microservices architecture, with dedicated services for users, posts, comments, and notifications. Each service utilizes appropriate databases and technologies to optimize performance and scalability. The platform supports horizontal scaling, high availability, and robust security measures to protect user data and maintain system integrity.

Architecture Design
Microservices
The platform is built using a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific aspect of the system. This approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each service. Here are the key microservices:

User Service
Responsibilities:

Manage user registration, authentication, and profiles.
Handle user-related data and operations.
Interactions:

Communicates with the Post Service to retrieve user-specific posts.
Interacts with the Notification Service to manage user notifications.
Post Service
Responsibilities:

Handle creation, retrieval, and management of posts.
Store and index post data for efficient querying.
Interactions:

Connects with the User Service to get information about post authors.
Works with the Comment Service to manage comments on posts.
Comment Service
Responsibilities:

Manage creation, retrieval, and moderation of comments on posts.
Store and index comment data for efficient querying.
Interactions:

Interfaces with the Post Service to associate comments with posts.
Communicates with the Notification Service to alert users about new comments.
Notification Service
Responsibilities:

Manage notifications for user activities (e.g., new comments, likes).
Store and deliver notifications in real-time or through batch processing.
Interactions:

Works with the User Service to deliver notifications to the correct users.
Interacts with the Post and Comment Services to generate notifications based on user activities.
Databases
The platform utilizes multiple databases, each chosen for its specific strengths, to handle different types of data efficiently.

PostgreSQL
Role:

Used for storing structured data related to users, including authentication details and profiles.
Benefits:

ACID compliance ensures data integrity and reliability.
Strong support for complex queries and transactions.
MongoDB
Role:

Used for storing semi-structured data such as posts, comments, and notifications.
Benefits:

Flexible schema design allows for rapid iteration and scaling.
High performance for read-heavy operations and horizontal scaling capabilities.
Redis
Role:

Used for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce load on primary databases.
Benefits:

Extremely fast read and write operations.
Supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, and sets.
Search
The platform incorporates powerful search capabilities to enable users to quickly find relevant content.

Elasticsearch
Role:

Provides full-text search capabilities across posts, comments, and user profiles.
Integration:

Indexes data from MongoDB for posts and comments, and from PostgreSQL for user profiles.
Real-time updates ensure search results are always up-to-date.
Benefits:

Distributed nature allows for horizontal scaling and high availability.
Advanced search features such as filtering, faceting, and aggregations enhance user experience.
Technical Implementation
Database Schemas
The platform uses both SQL and NoSQL databases, each with their respective schemas tailored to the needs of different services.

PostgreSQL: Contains schemas for user data including authentication details and profiles.
MongoDB: Holds schemas for posts, comments, and notifications, allowing flexible and scalable data storage.
Caching
Redis is employed to cache frequently accessed data, significantly improving the platform's performance. This reduces the load on the primary databases and ensures quicker data retrieval.

Search Indexing
Elasticsearch is integrated for its robust full-text search capabilities. It indexes data from both MongoDB and PostgreSQL, enabling efficient and scalable search functionality across the platform.

CI/CD Pipeline
The platform uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. This ensures that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed, maintaining the platform's reliability and performance.

Monitoring
Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring system performance. They provide real-time metrics and visualizations, helping to quickly identify and resolve any issues that arise.
